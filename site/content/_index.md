          "The Sinthome is a link that binds together the three rings of the
          borromean knot. Each ring represents an order of the psyche: The real,
          the symbolic, and the imaginary. They constitute subjectivity, and bound
          together, the way subjectivity is formed in and by the world. Language
          and images create a sense of the self that we use to identify ourselves
          and others, within known categories, recognizable traits, and diagnosed
          maladies. The Sinthome collection plays with the idea of becoming aware
          of this bind, and making movements, interactions, and expressions that
          undo it. Who are you in your REAL: before representation, reflection,
          and symbolization?"

        text: "I create objects that experiment with form and function, allowing the
          wearer to re-awaken an awareness of the interplay between themselves
          and their surroundings. Jewelry is a poignant and beautiful way to
          interface this experience: it sits on the skin, directly between the
          body and the world. Opening up the space of play between the porous
          boundaries of self and other."
