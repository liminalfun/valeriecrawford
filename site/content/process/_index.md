      them.

    text: I want to create objects that experiment with form and function, allowing
      the wearer to re-awaken an awareness of the interplay between themselves

    text: "Jewelry is a poignant and beautiful way to interface this experience: it
      sits on the skin, directly between the body and the world. Opening up the
      space of play between the porous boundaries of self and other."
  text_bottom:
    text: Each object was designed, hand-crafted, and worn and tested by me. The
      pieces are made with the body, to be comfortable, and yet engage something
      new and generative within you.
