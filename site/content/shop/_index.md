description: "The Sinthome is a link that binds together the three rings of the
  borromean knot. Each ring represents an order of the psyche: The real, the
  symbolic, and the imaginary. They constitute subjectivity, and bound together,
  the way subjectivity is formed in and by the world. Language and images create
  a sense of the self that we use to identify ourselves and others, within known
  categories, recognizable traits, and diagnosed maladies. The Sinthome
  collection plays with the idea of becoming aware of this bind, and making
  movements, interactions, and expressions that undo it. Who are you in your
  REAL: before representation, reflection, and symbolization?"
